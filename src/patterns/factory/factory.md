# Factory Pattern Explanation:

The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a
superclass, </br>
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. </br>
It promotes loose coupling by delegating the instantiation logic to specialized factory classes or methods. </br>
This pattern is particularly useful when the exact type of object to be created is determined dynamically at
runtime.</br>
